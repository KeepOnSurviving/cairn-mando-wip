# Setting

### Summary
- A setting has a **Theme**, **Terrain**, **Details**, and **Factions**. 
- See [this page](/wip/2e/example-setting) for an example setting, and generate (most) of the setting automatically with [this](https://perchance.org/cairn-setting-generator).
- Distance is measured in [**Watches**](/wip/2e/wilderness-exploration/#travel), assuming that the party travels by foot and on maintained roads.

## Theme
To help create your setting's theme, answer the following questions:
 - How does magic work?
 - What level of technology do the denizens have?
 - How does religion function? Do gods walk the lands, and do the people know it?
 - Who are the PCs in the setting? What is theirposition with respect to those in power?
 - What species & backgrounds exist, and are they playable by PCs?
 - What linguistic and cultural flavor exists in the setting? 

## Provinces
- A **Province** is a single, traversable landscape roughly defined by divisble terrain (mountain ranges, rivers, oceans). 
- A **Domain** is one or more adjacent **Provinces** defined by the same ruler(s). 
- Each **Province** has a **Heart**: a settlement (of any size) that reflects the history, **Factions**, and peoples of the land.

### Scale
- **Small Province**: A **Heart** no more than _four_ **Watches** from the furthest **Detail**.  
- **Medium Province**: A **Heart** no more than _eight_ **Watches** from the furthest **Detail**.
- **Large Province**: A **Heart** no more than _sixteen_ **Watches** from the furthest **Detail**.

### Creating a Province
1. On a flat sheet of paper, create a dot to signify the **Heart** of the **Province**. 
2. Create three more dots in a triangle with the **Heart** in the rough center. Each of these dots represents an additional **Detail** on the map. 
3. Connect two of the dots to the **Heart**, using solid lines to represent roads, dotted lines for trails, double solid lines for rivers, and double dotted lines for tunnels. 
4. Connect the remaining dot to one of these paths, crossing it and continuing for a distance. 
5. Repeat step **2**, orienting the triangle of dots in a different way than before. 
6. Connect two of the new dots to _any_ path, but do not connect the final dot to anything! This is the **Frontier**.
7. Create a new dot wherever paths cross, and wherever a new path ends. 
8. Number the dots, starting from the **Heart** and expanding outwards. The **Heart** is always **1**, and the **Frontier** is always the terminal number.

#### Tips
- You can increase the **Province Scale** by doubling the size of the triangle in step **5**, then adding dots halfway between two points on any line (roads, trails, rivers, etc).
- You can use other shapes (squares, rectangles, circles, etc) to create dots instead. You can even mix & match!
- You can repeat this process for any adjacent **Provinces**, connecting them by road, river, or range. 

### Adding Terrain
1. Roll on the [Terrain Table](#terrain-table) below for each numbered dot, starting with the **Heart**. 
2. Terrain modifiers are based on the [Terrain Difficulty](/wip/2e/wilderness-exploration/#terrain-difficulty) rules. **E** = Easy, **T** = Tough, **P** = Perilous.
3. Drawn or indicate the terrain for each dot on the map.

| **d12** |                                                                                                                    |
| **1**   | The clouds are shaped like faces. They appear to be laughing.                                                      |
| **2**   | Roaming, coughing, dust clouds that smell of cinnamon.                                                             |
| **3**   | Days are erratic. The Sun goes backwards for a time, then jumps forward rapidly as night quickly falls.            |
| **4**   | Lakes and streams dry up in minutes, filling storm clouds that drench the landscape.                               |
| **5**   | Rainbows lack most of their colors, and occasionally flicker. Raindrops fall in various colors. Do not taste them. |
| **6**   | Distant chimes instead of thunder. A smokey, sweet wind stems from the **West**, with no apparent origin.          |
| **7**   | Fog there fills the belly (no need for rations). Tomorrow, vomiting.                                               |
| **8**   | The winds carry whispers; some sawy with hints of the future.                                                      |
| **9**   | Shadows disappear at random. Animals do not want to go there.                                                      |
| **10**  | Flashes of movement in the periphery. They always amount to nothing. Travelers return without their memories.      |
| **11**  | The air is thicker than usual, and breathing is difficult. Drinking water seems to help.                           |
| **12**  | Rains of small aquatic creatures (tadpoles, frogs, small fish). No one seems to knows where they come from.        |

## Details
- Each dot on the map is one **Detail**. **Details** act as [**Points**](/wip/2e/wilderness-exploration/#points) according to the [**Wilderness Exploration**](/wip/2e/wilderness-exploration) rules. Keep in mind how many **Watches** it might take to travel to each **Detail**. 
- The **Heart** of a **Province** is always a settlement. It isn't necessarily the largest or most important place in the setting, but it should always have a significant history. 
- Assume there are small villages scattered around larger settlements. These do not need to be represented by dots or **Details**!   

### Adding Details
1. Roll on the [Settlements](#settlements) and [Settlement Features](#settlement-features) tables to generate the **Heart** of the **Province**.
2. Generate features for each remaining dot _except_ the **Frontier** by first rolling on the the [Detail Types](#detail-types) table, then on the associated table.
3. For any additional Settlements rolled, roll on the [Settlement Features](#settlement-features) table as well.
4. Generate features for the **Frontier** by rolling _only_ the [Special](#special) table.

> If some of the results below seem incongruous, that's OK! Turn it into a question: _Why_ is there **hazardous** terrain so close to a settlement? Perhaps there were mines there once, long abandoned. Rumors as to their true treasure - and dangers - abound! That said, don't be afraid to choose a more appropriate result if you're having a hard time making it work!

### Detail Names
- Settlements are often named after their unique features: the shape of the river nearby, or the large windmill in the town center. The residents then add a noun or adjective: _Windy Gulch, Black Tree Fort, Pitty Gardens_, etc.
- Important places (like cities) should have important names, like those of heroes, religious/political figures, and important events: _The Chalet of Saint Ibiz, Queen's Harvest, Light of the Nine_, etc.
- Wild and dangerous places are named after their obvious hazards: poison lake, greedy mines, etc. Some tell a story: _Luka's Folly, Dead Man's Path_, etc. 

#### Generating Names
- Starting with the **Heart**, roll on the [Name Formulas](#name-formulas) table to name each **Detail** on the map. 
- Roll on the [Adjectives](#adjectives) and [Nouns](#nouns) table where appropriate, and consult the [Terrain Synonyms](#terrain-synonyms) table for inspiration. 
- Refer to the [Example Names](#example-names) for a model of each table result. [**Proper Nouns**] can be added to or even replace parts of a name, e.g. **Bruna's Ugly Gulch**. 

| To roll 1d100, roll 2d10, using one die for the tens place, and one for the ones place.

## Factions
- Factions rule over one or more **Details**, an entire **Province**, or even a **Domain**. 
- The map should reflect the impact of goals being completed or interrupted. **Factions** will work to complete their **Agenda** independently.
- A **Faction** may be governed by a powerful figure, but most of the time PCs will be dealing with their lieutenants, or **Seneschals**. 

### Agendas & Advantages
- **Factions** have **Agendas** (3-4 **goals** towards a clear objective) and the **Advantages** to help achieve them. 
- **Advantages** reflect a **Factions'** influence, materials, wealth, and special features. 
- **Factions** add (or lose) their **Advantages** by trying to complete their agenda. 

### Creating Factions
- Consider the **Details** and **Terrain** you've developed. Note what is worth protecting, as well as what is worth taking.
- **Agendas** are lofty plans with distinct steps based on actionable goals. They should relate to the acquisition of powerful territory, weapons, money, and **Advantages**. 
- Do not feel limited by the table results below. If something feels "off" or a different table result would work better for your setting, use it!

#### Factions Creation Procedure
- First, follow steps **1-5** for every Settlement **Detail** on the map, starting with the **Heart**.
- Then, select either a Lair or Ruin on the map. Follow steps 1-5 to make at least one **Faction** for that site. 
- Repeat as desired.
1. Roll on the [Faction Types](#faction-types) table to determine the nature of the Faction. 
2. Consider how many Advantages a Faction of this type might have (between 2-4) and roll accordingly on the [Faction Advantages](#faction-Advantages) table. Flesh out the specifics of the Advantages as indicated by the results from the table. 
3. Roll on the the [**Faction Agendas**](#faction-agendas) table and consider what their specific **Agenda** may be given your current information. Establish a series of goals (3-4) that must be accomplished for this **Agenda** to be accomplished.
4. Roll on the [Faction Obstacles](#faction-obstacles) table. Use the result to consider what might prevent the **Agenda** from succeeding.
5. Create at least one **Seneschal**, inspired by the **Faction** type, **Advantages**, and **Agenda**, and **Obstacle**. Think of where they might be located on the map. Make that location the **Faction's** home base.

| **1**   | **Academic**      | _Royal Topographer's Society_. An upstart cartographer's guild, preparing to map the **Far Reaches**. Many have tried, but none have returned. |
| **2**   | **Arcane**        | _The Syndak_. A league of wizards in search of an ancient power. They cannot allow it to fall into the wrong hands.                            |
| **3**   | **Cabal**         | _Praxis._ A secret society, its machinations shrouded in mystery. But its goal is all too clear: a new world order.                            |
| **4**   | **Commoners**     | _Unite or Perish_. Together, they are strong. Together they can move mountains. But who do they really serve?                                  |
| **5**   | **Criminal**      | _Missing Fingers_. An uneasy alliance of ruffians, thieves, and killers. Their boss is the most terrifying of them all.                        |
| **6**   | **Government**    | _The Bloc_. Politicians, bureaucrats, tax collectors: they are everywhere. Who are they helping, besides themselves?                           |
| **7**   | **Industrial**    | _The Iron Pantheon_. Workers, united by a charismatic and troubled leader. Fighting for a better life.                                         |
| **8**   | **Mercantile**    | _Earnest Buyer's Club_. A cartel of beaming merchants, vendors, and trade experts. Followers of none, save for the almighty coin.              |
| **9**   | **Military**      | _Azure Guard_. Disgraced officers, relying on their only remaining assets: a soldier's loyalty. It might be enough.                            |
| **10**  | **Noble**         | _Lichthammer_. A family built on deft politicking. Their house is in debt to a dangerous group, and they could lose everything.                |
| **11**  | **Religious**     | _His Noble Justice._ Stewards of sacred artifacts, guided by the divine to reclaim their most holy of objects.                                 |
| **12**  | **Revolutionary** | _Light Rising_. The body politic is diseased beyond redemption. Plenty are ready to die for the cause, but only one is fit to lead them.       |

| **1**   | **Dog Eat Dog**           | Another **Faction** is vying for the same or similar **Agenda**.                |
| **2**   | **Cloak & Dagger**        | The **Agenda** must be carried out in absolute secrecy.                         |
| **3**   | **Guardian at the Gate**  | A powerful figure or foe must be eliminated to ensure a successful **Agenda**.  |
| **4**   | **Consequnces are Dire**  | The **Agenda** contravenes an established code. Violation pays a heavy penalty. |

| **10**  | **Limited Means**         | Considerable capital will be required to carry out the **Agenda**.              |

| **12**  | **Body Count**            | Someone must die to ensure a successful outcome. The **Agenda** demands it.     |

#### Example Faction
- **Academic**: _Royal Cartographer's Guild_
- **Base**: _Seaside Athenaeum_
##### Advantages
- **Apparatus**: A _Map of the Dead_. It opens a path to the underworld, and to the secrets of the dead.  
- **Position**: The _Seaside Athenaeum_ is both well-defended and steeped in forbidden secrets. 
- **Renown**: None would dare defy the _Guild_ publicly. Their voice carries great weight in the kingdom.
- **Seneschals**: _Dr. Horatia Confi_, first order. Discovered the _Map of the Dead_. Stats as human (WIL 15).  
- **Agenda**: **Destroy**. The _Guild_ has long been at war with the _Holy Order of Yix_ (figuratively and otherwise) for over a century. It is time their ignorant sect was brought to its knees. _The Order_ is currently favored by the monarchy, but that could all change.
  - Hire a skilled party, and lead them to the _Gates of the Underworld_. _Dr. Confi_ will lead the expedition.   
  - Travel through the lands of the dead in search of the _Order_'s founder, and force their to reveal an ancient secret.
  - Reveal the founder's secrets - including their true identity - to the monarchy. Tie up any loose ends, including witnesses.
- **Obstacle**: **Rotten From Within**. The _Guild_ has received legitimate intelligence that a well-placed operative moves within their ranks, and is aware of the coming operation.

### Faction Rules
- By default, **Factions** operate independent of the player character's actions. If the PCs do nothing, the **Factions** should still act to achieve their aims.
- Whenever a **Faction** is positioned to advance a goal in their **Agenda**, roll a **d12** on the [Faction Actions](#faction-actions) table. 
- If two **Factions** are _opposed_, the **Faction** _most at risk_ makes a WIL save, using the score of its highest-ranking **Seneschal**. 
  - On a success, the **Faction** most at risk rolls on the [Faction Actions](#faction-actions) table, and their opponent does not.
  - On a fail, the **Faction** most at risk _does not_ roll on the [Faction Actions](#faction-actions) table, but their opponent does.

| **9-10**  | **Success**       | A **goal** is achieved, and no **Advantages** are lost.        |
| **11-12** | **Major Success** | A **goal** is achieved, and a new **Advantage** is found.      |

> The actions of the PCs can always overrule the necessity for a **Faction** action, or in some cases provide an advantage of some kind to the roll. 

## Province Name
Consider the following when determining the **Province** name:
- What are the key geographic features of the region? 
- What major events (war, famine, discoveries) occured here in the past? Who were the major players?
- What sort of factions have historically dominated this place?
- A name may also include a reference to the region's relative position to the seat of power: _The Northeast Redoubt_, _Western Ranges_, etc.
- The name (first, or family) of a "discoverer", conquerer or colonizer often sticks around long after their death.

## Conclusion
Congratulations, your **Province** is complete! You can now "drill down" into various locations (starting with the **Heart**) and build out each **Detail** on your own favorite tables. Keep the following thoughts in mind as you go:
- How might the interactions between the **Factions** interact with the landscape, its features, and one another? How will this change as the **Factions** succeed (or fail) at their goals? 
Consider which **Factions** may be allied, and which opposed? Keep in mind the region's history, what a **Faction** might have that others would want, and what someone would do to _get_ them. 
- Consider the history of the region's original "discoverers", the locals they may have supplanted, and where both groups are today. 
- When building out the next **Province**, keep in mind how it would have interacted historically with this **Province**, and what might happen between them in the future.

> If you find anything _amiss_ or **wrong** feel free to change it, or add your own **Details**. Remember, it's _your_ setting.
